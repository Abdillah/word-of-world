# Wordy World
An online crowdsource service to collect things and perspective propery of things in fantasy generated world.
Started from https://schema.org categories then we adds up to other categories.

## Vision
I envisioned this project as a milestone to create virtual world with automatic and dynamic description 
of places and objects that can be explored. The description is derived from the properties with the help
of AI.

## Editorial
For the first start, this project will import schema.org properties.
After that, start to add more voted perspective property from crowdsource with UI dashboard.

## Disclaimer
This project is highly experimental. Even afterward, the AI description engine needs 
to be build with existing technology. I have yet the capacity for realizing the AI-powered engine.
But, maybe I can create simple picky description engine (take some properties and convert to sentence).
